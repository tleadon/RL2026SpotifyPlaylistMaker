I made this because I was too lazy making a Rolling Loud prep playlist myself so it uses DeezerAPI to get the top songs for artists it can find and playwright to add those to a playlist. I used rows of the rolling loud 2026 poster as the "tiers". Higher tier = more songs. Deezer doesn't have a few artists though so...

Sorry to:
